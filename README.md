This is the homepage for my project maple, an open source software I have developed for self-monitoring your dog. The tool features audio event detection and classification, interactive plots for analyzing dog behavior, and intervening logic so that you can praise your dog for being quiet, console it for whining, scold it for barking, with pre-recorded audio of yourself.
